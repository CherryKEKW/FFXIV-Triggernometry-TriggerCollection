# FFXIV-Triggernometry TriggerCollection

A collection of triggers for FFXIV, used by the ACT Plugin Triggernometry.

## Scopes of these plugins

Triggernometry can be used for MANY different things.

This project compiles a list a useful triggers.
However, it excludes any trigger that is meant to handhold you during a boss fight. I personnaly don't want to play with DeadlyBossMods for WoW.

## Getting Started

To use those triggers, you first need to :

- Install [Advanced Combat Tracker](https://advancedcombattracker.com/)
- Install the [ACT FFXIV plugin](https://advancedcombattracker.com/includes/page-download.php?id=66)
- Install the [ACT Triggernometry plugin](http://solitude.guildwork.com/_/triggernometry)

For more information about Triggernometry, you can check their [discord server](https://discord.gg/6f9MY55).

## Finding triggers

Each folder in this repo contains a README that describes what the triggers do.

### Language limitations

Triggers are basically looking for lines in the combat log.
And as the combat log is translated in the FXIV Client language, the triggers are language sensitive.

Trigger files are tagged with the language they are meant for.
*AwesomeName*_EN.xml will only work for the English client of the game.

## Importing triggers

Once you've found the trigger export you want, you need to import it in Triggernometry.

The [Eurekan Explorers discord](https://discord.gg/WBXw9pN) has a neat [explaination](https://imgur.com/gallery/ZxJ8o) for this process.
