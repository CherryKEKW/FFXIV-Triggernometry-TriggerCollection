## Triggers

The triggers are split per Extension, but they all are built in the same way

### *Extension* [A/B]-Rank Nearby

Detects : The presence of a *rank* monster nearby.

For B and A ranks, the detection radius is small.

Actions : Says `[A/B] rank [Mob name] nearby`

### *Extension* [A/B/S]-Rank Pop

Detects : The pop of a *rank* monster nearby.

For B and A ranks, the detection radius is small. If a mob pops outside or the detection radius, the trigger won't detect it.

For S rank, it should detect the monster as soon as it spawns wherever you are in the zone.

Actions : Says `[A/B/S] rank [Mob name] pop`

### *Extension* S-Rank In Zone

Detects : The presence of an S rank monster in the zone.

For S ranks, the detection radius is usually the whole zone, so you should hear this trigger as soon as you load in.

Actions : Says `S rank [Mob name] in zone`

These triggers were provided on pastebin and linked on the [FFXIV Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/) a long time ago. I don't remember who the original authors were though.
